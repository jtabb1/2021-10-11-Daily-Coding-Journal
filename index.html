      Today I got my project online by following a Flatiron guide 
      (unpublished for this course) found by Lisa Swart.  I also had to 
      familiarize myself with Heroku enough to launch the working project and 
      work through some of the errors that didn't show up when I was 
      only using the project with Sqlite 3.  I continued my work from 
      yesterday and I was finished by this morning.

      I spent the rest of the day learning about and shopping for pepper spray 
      and stun guns to use them in self-defense after a tenant of mine 
      threatened my life about a couple of weeks ago.  That has been a time 
      consuming oddisey that has seen me improve my business to be able 
      to sustain break-ins to my onsite apartment (I live in the same 
      building with my three other tenant apartments) as well as my death.  
      I think that I handled the situation well based on what I had - I did a lot 
      of things right prior to the confrontation that made a difficult 
      situation go safer.  I also did some correct things during and after 
      the confrontation as well.  I credit prayer and my and others' struggle to 
      conform to God's will for this - and for my part, I will try to do a 
      better job of doing God's will (sometimes I don't know exactly what to 
      do about or struggle to find the energy or will to do it) to make future 
      potential difficult situations better.  My biggest challenge here as I see 
      it is doing what I need to do faster and with less cost to my aspirations 
      to do computer programming for a living.

      I expect that the specific oddisey I am having with the threatening tenant 
      will end in terms of a dedicated time commitment from me with me finishing another court notice.  Ultimately, more general improvements to my business will be: a best-in-industry lease, 
      more up to date business logging, and more stringent tenant acceptance 
      requirements (with all of the additional improvements that this will 
      bring).
